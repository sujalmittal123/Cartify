          <h2>About Shoppy</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to Shoppy, your number one source for all things products.
            We're dedicated to giving you the very best of products, with a focus

          <p>
            Founded in 2025, Shoppy has come a long way from its beginnings.
            When we first started out, our passion for providing the best
            equipment for our fellow merchants drove us to do intense research,
            and gave us the impetus to turn hard work and inspiration into to a
            booming online store. We now serve customers all over the world,
            and are thrilled to be a part of the quirky, eco-friendly, fair
            trade wing of the industry.
